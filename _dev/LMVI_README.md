# LazyDINO Tutorial

## Getting Started

See the [LazyDINO tutorial](https://github.com/joshuawchen/lazydino_tutorial/blob/main/LazyDINO_Tutorial.ipynb) for a complete walkthrough of the LazyDINO pipeline: problem setup, DINO training, LMVI training, and approximate posterior sampling

## Installation

### Step 1 — Install dinox (follow README to install correctly, a pip install alone will not suffice)

```bash
# With CuPy GPU support (recommended)
pip install dinox[cupy]

# Without CuPy
pip install dinox
```

### Step 2 - Install flowjax

```bash
pip install flowjax==19.1.0
```
